â™¦  Hello !! This is my Internship project at
-The Sparks foundation for the Sep 2021 batch.

  TSF GRIP Task- Payment Integration Gateway

âšª Create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.

âšª There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.

âšª Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.

âšª On any page / email, only basic information is needed.

âšª Create your own temporary / sandbox / testing accounts with 3rd party for integrations.

âšª Host the website at 000webhost, github.io, heroku app or any other free hosting provider. Check in code in gitlab.
